ji# 🎓 Student Result Management System  

**A web-based solution to streamline result accessibility and management for students and administrators.**

## 📜 Overview  
The **Student Result Management System** is a user-friendly platform that addresses the challenges faced by students and administrators in accessing and managing academic results.  
Previously in our college, results were shared via Excel sheets, creating accessibility issues. This project provides a secure and centralized system to resolve this problem.
